      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Sean. I am 12 years old and I've been working with my coding coach, Acelia,   in python. We just recently moved to processing with python.

Processing is a programming language that allows you to create 3D as well as 2D graphics. I've been working in processing for about three months. The project that I'm about to show you is one that I've created along the way

My program is a 3d simulation of the great northern hemisphere. The constellations are 2d graphics on a 3d plain. In order to understand the 3-dimensions, because I have not learned how to graph coordinates 3-Dimensionally in school yet, we went over a 3D graph. (Show 3D Graph) 
-The Y-axis in processing is up and down. Positive Y is down and negative is up
-The X-axis is side to side. Positive X is right and negative is left. 
-And lastly, the Z-axis is how close or far from you the object appears to be. Positive Z is closer and negative is farther.

So now that we went over the 3D plane, here is the northern hemisphere in 3D (Pull Up constellationsP3)

Tell them about my code and what each section does
